        <h3>Quiz 4: How can I make my website more accessible?</h3>
        <p>
            For my hyperlinks to the blog, home and research project, i should make these into larger buttons
            where it is easier for people to see that this is a link. At the moment, it is very small and if
            someone had impaired sight, it might be hard for them to realise that they can click on this and find
            out more about me.
        </p>

        <h3>Quiz 5: How to change fonts</h3>
        <p>
            I have set up so headings are in Ariel, sans-serif and the rest of the text that is in the body of the page,
            is
            in Courier New in the CSS class.
        </p>

        <h3>Quiz 6: How to change the colour</h3>
        <p>
            I used the website to check the contrast and found that I like this colour and the contrast is good and easy
            to
            read with black text.

        <h3>Quiz 7: Layout and responsive design</h3>
        <p>
            I have created a header and different divisions for the main content of the page. As we can see all
            the content is in the middle of the page. I have set the images so they take up a portion of the main
            division content. This means when the page is resized, the images will also change size. The text also
            stays in the middle of the page as well. The navigation bar is at the top of the page, and is also resized
            with the size of the tab.
        </p>

        <h3>Quiz 9: Interactive design experiment</h3>
        <p>
            I really like it when you click it looks like you are pushing a physical button. So when you hover over
            the navigation bar it expands and when you click it, it goes smaller again. This helps with understanding what
            you are doing on a website instead of maybe missing where you are supposed to click.
