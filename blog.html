        <h3>Quiz 4: How can I make my website more accessible?</h3>
        <p>
            For my hyperlinks to the blog, home and research project, i should make these into larger buttons
            where it is easier for people to see that this is a link. At the moment, it is very small and if
            someone had impaired sight, it might be hard for them to realise that they can click on this and find
            out more about me.
        </p>

        <h3>Quiz 5: How to change fonts</h3>
        <p>
            I have set up so headings are in Ariel, sans-serif and the rest of the text that is in the body of the page,
            is
            in Courier New in the CSS class.
        </p>

        <h3>Quiz 6: How to change the colour</h3>
        <p>
            I used the website to check the contrast and found that I like this colour and the contrast is good and easy
            to
            read with black text.

             class="image-spacing">

        <h3>Quiz 7: Layout and responsive design</h3>
        <p>
            I have created a header and different divisions for the main content of the page. As we can see all
            the content is in the middle of the page. I have set the images so they take up a portion of the main
            division content. This means when the page is resized, the images will also change size. The text also
            stays in the middle of the page as well. The navigation bar is at the top of the page, and is also resized
            with the size of the tab.

        <h1>Web Design Research Report - The Good and the Bad of the Web</h1>

        <h4>Positive web design patterns:</h4>
        <ol type="1" class="researchList">
            <li class="webDesignList">
                Simplicity
            </li>
            <p>
                Having simple designs on a website can make someone more engaged and more likely to remain on the
                website.
                Nearly half of website visitors abandon a site after viewing just one page (6 Key Components of Good
                Website
                Design | Webflow Blog, 2025). The effect of having a clean website is that it is easy to see and
                understand.
                It will make it easier for everyone to learn more about the topic on the site. Making sure that things
                on
                the website are not all bunched together to make it hard to read. These will also make the website
                quicker
                to load another page as there isn’t as much for it to load which will keep people engaged on the
                website.
            </p>

            <li class="webDesignList">
                Screen readers
            </li>
            <p>
                Having an option of a screen reader is important for someone who has a sight impairment. Making sure to
                have
                proper accessibility in a website is important so you account for every person who needs your website.
                To
                make this work you need to make sure that absolutely everything on the page can be read by the screen
                reader, including images. The effect this is to make sure that the person gets as much information as
                possible, and so they don’t miss out on things that could be important. You will get a wider audience of
                people that can use your website as well, which could be good if you are selling things for example.
            </p>
            <img src="images/screenreader.jpg" width="80%" alt="photo of screen readers" class="image-spacing">
            <br>
            <li class="webDesignList">
                Having an organised web page
            </li>
            <p>
                Your website must be well organised by:
            <ul>
                <li>Using colours that contrast well so things are easily readable</li>
                <li>Having sufficient whitespace and</li>
                <li>Having an appropriate scale on the website.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            The effect of these three things will help with the simplicity of the website and to help people stay
            engaged.
            Also, will help people that cannot see very well, having an easy-to-read website will help these people with
            this disability. Having whitespace can help to highlight parts of the website you want people to see or
            click
            on.

        <h4>Negative web design patterns:</h4>
        <ol type="1" class="researchList">
            <li class="webDesignList">
                Bait and switch
            </li>
            <p>
                This is when fake information is put forward to trick the user. They become interested and makes them
                continue by clicking on it. Once they click though, what they wanted to happen usually is not the case
                at
                all and can force them into doing something they didn’t want to do. The effects of this are bad and
                makes
                people not trust the website and therefore, leave and maybe report the website. An example of this is
                the
                Windows 10 dialog box, where clicking ‘X’ initialises the upgrade process (Singh, 2021).

            <br>
            <li class="webDesignList">
                Preselection
            </li>
            <p>
                This is when you are going to pay for a subscription (usually), and you have different options you can
                choose from that vary in price. There is usually always one option that is selected by default. The
                effect
                of this is that people may not see that and think they have selected the one they want but then actually
                pay
                much more since they hadn’t chosen correctly. People might feel cheated/scammed by the website since
                they
                didn’t really want this option, and they paid it on accident and therefore may just refuse to use it
                altogether.
            </p>

            <li class="webDesignList">
                Fake social proof
            </li>
            <p>
                this is when you have fake likes, comments or shares that usually say positive things about something.
                This is so they can attract more people into looking and engaging with what they are advertising so they
                can make more money. The effect of this on people is that it can deceive them into using an “approved”
                program and waste time. Once people find out they’re being misled this creates loss of trust and if they
                have spent money, then more damage to their reputation will happen toward the person posting the ad.
