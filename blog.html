        <h3>Quiz 4: How can I make my website more accessible?</h3>
        <p>
            For my hyperlinks to the blog, home and research project, i should make these into larger buttons
            where it is easier for people to see that this is a link. At the moment, it is very small and if
            someone had impaired sight, it might be hard for them to realise that they can click on this and find
            out more about me.
        </p>

        <h3>Quiz 5: How to change fonts</h3>
        <p>
            I have set up so headings are in Ariel, sans-serif and the rest of the text that is in the body of the page,
            is
            in Courier New in the CSS class.
        </p>

             class="image-spacing">

        <h3>Quiz 6: How to change the colour</h3>
        <p>
            I used the website to check the contrast and found that I like this colour and the contrast is good and easy
            to
            read with black text.
        </p>

             class="image-spacing">

        <h3>Quiz 7: Layout and responsive design</h3>
        <p>
            I have created a header and different divisions for the main content of the page. As we can see all
            the content is in the middle of the page. I have set the images so they take up a portion of the main
            division content. This means when the page is resized, the images will also change size. The text also
            stays in the middle of the page as well. The navigation bar is at the top of the page, and is also resized
            with the size of the tab.
        </p>

        <h3>Quiz 9: Interactive design experiment</h3>
        <p>
            I really like it when you click it looks like you are pushing a physical button. So when you hover over
            the navigation bar it expands and when you click it, it goes smaller again. This helps with understanding
            what
            you are doing on a website instead of maybe missing where you are supposed to click.

        <h1>Research for my portfolio</h1>
        <h4>27/01/25</h4>
        <img src="images/insporationPortfolio.png" width="80%" alt="screenshot of my insporation portfolio"
             class="image-spacing">
        <img src="images/gorgeousContrast.png" width="80%" alt="screenshot of my gorgeous contrast example"

        <a href="https://visme.co/blog/website-color-schemes/"> gorgeousContrast</a>
        <p>
            Since I’m looking for a cyber security job, the green and black portrays the hacker theme so I decided to
            use that colour scheme to represent that a bit.
        </p>
        <h4>30/01/25</h4>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign1.png" width="80%" alt="screenshot of my first stage of my portfolio"
             class="image-spacing">
        <p> I have centred all the images and heading text, next step will be to make for the middle of the website
            so the text is above and under all the images.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign2.png" width="80%" alt="screenshot of my second stage of my portfolio"
             class="image-spacing">
        <img src="images/divisionsSetup.png" width="80%" alt="screenshot of my divisions setup" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Now I have set up in the blog page so there is the main content, which is in the middle, the navigation bar
            on the left and then the remaining space on the right.

        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign3.png" width="80%" alt="screenshot of my third stage of my portfolio"
             class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            I’ve decided that I like the navigation bar at the top better than on the left so next step will be to
            change that, so the navigation is in the header.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign4.png" width="80%" alt="screenshot of my fourth stage of my portfolio"
             class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Now navigation bar is in the header of the website. Made a header division and made the height of the header
            100 pixels.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign5.png" width="80%" alt="screenshot of my fifth stage of my portfolio"
             class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            I now made the navigation bar centred at the top of the website and made it green to keep with the theme. I
            have changed the writing to be in white to better contrast with the background for readability.
        </p>
        <h4>3/02/25</h4>
        <img src="images/portfolioInsporation2.png" width="80%" alt="another inspiration for my portfolio"
             class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            I like how Moritz has displayed his case studies in rectangle blocks, this makes it very clear where each
            case study starts and finished on the website and makes it easier to read. Having the rounded edges as well
            makes it feel modern and gives it depth.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioInpsoration3.png" width="80%" alt="another inspiration for my portfolio"
             class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            I also like how he has a circular picture of him which goes well on the page.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign6.png" width="80%" alt="stage 6 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            I have made the navigation bar look like buttons now to make it more visible and now you can easily see
            where you need to click to change page.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign7.png" width="80%" alt="stage 7 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign8.png" width="80%" alt="stage 8 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Made it now so when you hover over the navigation bar it changes colour and becomes slightly bigger. Also
            made it go smaller again when we click on it to make it look like you are pressing it. This makes it much
            easier to see what you are doing on the website. You make not realise where the cursor is but this will make
            it easier for your eyes to catch where it is.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign9.png" width="80%" alt="stage 9 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            I have rearranged the home page to look a bit cleaner. Having my name bold and right in the middle and
            nicely contrast, makes it very eye catching and one of the first things your eyes look at when the page is
            loaded.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign10.png" width="80%" alt="stage 10 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Put profile picture on the left but still needs a bit of work to make look better.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign11.png" width="80%" alt="stage 11 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Have made it fit correctly but image does not scale with different sized tab.
        </p>
        <h4>4/02/25</h4>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign12.png" width="80%" alt="stage 12 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Spent most of the day fixing up one of my old projects so I can add it on my portfolio and make sure it
            works correctly. Took the idea from Moritz portfolio and did my own spin on it.
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign13.png" width="80%" alt="stage 13 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            added another project which is this portfolio.
        </p>
        <h4>5/02/25</h4>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign14.png" width="80%" alt="stage 14 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Added my social media accounts in the top right corner
        </p>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign15.png" width="80%" alt="stage 15 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            This is the CSS code for the social media to make them look nice on the screen. I made them a unordered list
            in the header of the index.html file. This makes it easier to control all of them at once instead of
            individually.
        </p>
        <h4>7/02/25</h4>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign16.png" width="80%" alt="stage 16 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Added my experience and some writing along with it explaining what I do and have done. Also stating what
            skills these jobs have taught me.
            <br>
            I have also made the projects and experiences slide in from the right and the left respectively.
        </p>
        <h4>10/02/25</h4>
        <img src="images/portfolioDesign17.png" width="80%" alt="stage 17 of my portfolio" class="image-spacing">
        <p>
            Added skills section and write about non-technical and technical skills. These also slide in from the right
            when scrolling down to them.
