                Hi everyone, thanks for checking out my portfolio. I am passionate Cybersecurity guy who really enjoys
                learning about
                how to make things safe and secure. I also really enjoy understanding why an exploit works and what has
                changed
                to fix the issue. I am currently third and final year of my degree in Computer Science specialising in
                Cybersecurity at
                Victoria University of Wellington.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

             In my free time I love to go mountain biking, playing video games and hanging out with my mates in the
                outdoors.

            </p>

                    <h3>Encryption and Decryption</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is project uses the command line to encrypt and decrypt files. There are four different parts
                        to the project. Part one you can choose how you want to encrypt a plaintext file. You can choose
                        the mode of encryption and choose the output file name. Part two you choose a password to encrypt the
                        file with, and then decrypt that file using that password. Part three measured the time to decrypt
                        for a long text and a short text with different modes as well. Lastly part four trys to brute force the
                        password of a file.

                    <p>
                        This is the portfolio who are reading right now. This is my latest project that I am working on.
                        I have gone with the green and black colour way to represent a "hacker" theme, since I really
                        enjoy cybersecurity, I thought this portrays my interest in it even more. The contrast is great,
                        so everyone can easily read it.

                    I am a retail salesman at a bike shop located in the center of Wellington. My job is to help people
                    with sorting them out a new bike or helping them repair an existing bike. I also help people with
                    finding the correct gear they may need for a race or a bike backpacking trip. I've learnt great
                    communication skills and teamwork skills whilst in this company.

                        Very similar to the job at MyRide except this also involved selling outdoor equipment. This includes
                        tents, tramping gear, climbing gear, ski gear, etc. This job was the foundation of my communication
                        skills and teamwork skills which I have now built upon.
