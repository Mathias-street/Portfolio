            Hi everyone, thanks for checking out my portfolio. I am passionate Cybersecurity guy who really enjoys
            learning about
            how to make things safe and secure. I also really enjoy understanding why an exploit works and what has
            changed
            to fix the issue. I am currently third and final year of my degree in Computer Science specialising in
            Cybersecurity at
            Victoria University of Wellington.
        </p>

        <p>

            In my free time I love to go mountain biking, playing video games and hanging out with my mates in the
            outdoors.

                    <h3>Encryption and Decryption</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is project uses the command line to encrypt and decrypt files. There are four different parts
                        to the project. Part one you can choose how you want to encrypt a plaintext file. You can choose
                        the mode of encryption and choose the output file name. Part two you choose a password to encrypt the
                        file with, and then decrypt that file using that password. Part three measured the time to decrypt
                        for a long text and a short text with different modes as well. Lastly part four trys to brute force the
                        password of a file.

                    <p>
                        This is the portfolio who are reading right now. This is my latest project that I am working on.
                        I have gone with the green and black colour way to represent a "hacker" theme, since I really
                        enjoy cybersecurity, I thought this portrays my interest in it even more. The contrast is great,
                        so everyone can easily read it.
