                Hi everyone, thanks for checking out my portfolio. I am passionate Cybersecurity guy who really enjoys
                learning about
                how to make things safe and secure. I also really enjoy understanding why an exploit works and what has
                changed
                to fix the issue. I am currently third and final year of my degree in Computer Science specialising in
                Cybersecurity at
                Victoria University of Wellington.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>

             In my free time I love to go mountain biking, playing video games and hanging out with my mates in the
                outdoors.

                    <h3>Encryption and Decryption</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is project uses the command line to encrypt and decrypt files. There are four different parts
                        to the project. Part one you can choose how you want to encrypt a plaintext file. You can choose
                        the mode of encryption and choose the output file name. Part two you choose a password to encrypt the
                        file with, and then decrypt that file using that password. Part three measured the time to decrypt
                        for a long text and a short text with different modes as well. Lastly part four trys to brute force the
                        password of a file.

                    <p>
                        This is the portfolio who are reading right now. This is my latest project that I am working on.
                        I have gone with the green and black colour way to represent a "hacker" theme, since I really
                        enjoy cybersecurity, I thought this portrays my interest in it even more. The contrast is great,
                        so everyone can easily read it.

                    I am a retail salesman at a bike shop located in the center of Wellington. My job is to help people
                    with sorting them out a new bike or helping them repair an existing bike. I also help people with
                    finding the correct gear they may need for a race or a bike backpacking trip. I have learnt to use
                    POS and make sure everything is booked in properly so everyone can read and access things easily.

                        Very similar to the job at MyRide except this also involved selling outdoor equipment. This includes
                        tents, tramping gear, climbing gear, ski gear, etc.

            <h1>Skills Summary</h1>
            <h3>Non-technical skills</h3>
            <h4 class="skillNames">Communication</h4>
            <p>
                While being at a bike shop I have learnt great communication skills. Sometimes, people can get upset when
                their bike hasn't been fixed on time and ive learnt with using good communication you can explain to
                someone what the situation is so they understand what we are doing to get their bike to them as fast as possible.
            </p>
            <h3>Technical skills</h3>
            <h4 class="skillNames">Scripting</h4>
            <p>
                I have learnt to script in Linux to make different types of cyber attacks work on a vulnerable system. I
                had to do this for one of the assignments in my cyber security paper. An example is we were given a
                system that was vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack. I had to change the shellcode to a malicious
                one and implanted it at the end of the NOP sled to create a buffer overflow attack.
            </p>
            <h4 class="skillNames">Setting permissions on a system</h4>
            <p>
                I have learnt how to set permissions to files and directories to make sure only certain users and
                groups have access to certain files and directories. An example is I had to make a cybr371 setup
                script to set up the course as if I was the lecturer. This script had to make all he files and
                directories and then set permissions for lecturers and tutors to access certain things that the
                students could not access. This involved making groups and users and making sure that not in
                one case a student could access another studentâ€™s directory or access any exam questions.
            </p>
            <h4 class="skillNames">WireShark</h4>
            <p>
                I have used the tool WireShark to look at packets that are going over the network. One example was that
                I needed to see the difference between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3. In WireShark I could easily see the difference
                between two parties initialising encrypted messaging and the process of how encryption is established.
